  <title>Web Security Threats Report</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Web applications are integral to modern businesses, but they are also prime targets for cyberattacks. 
  Security threats such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), 
  Session Hijacking, and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks pose significant risks to data integrity, 
  user privacy, and system availability. This report explores these threats, examines real-world 
  incidents, and discusses effective mitigation strategies.
</p>

<h2>2. SQL Injection</h2>
<h3>Definition & Mechanism</h3>
<p>
  SQL Injection (SQLi) occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL queries into input fields, 
  manipulating the database to extract, modify, or delete sensitive data.
</p>

<h3>Real-World Case Study: Sony Pictures (2011)</h3>
<p>
  In 2011, Sony Pictures suffered a massive SQL injection attack that exposed personal data of 
  over 1 million users, including passwords stored in plaintext. The attackers exploited weak 
  input validation in Sony’s web forms.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): Ensures inputs are treated as data, not executable code.</li>
  <li>Input Validation & Sanitization: Filters out malicious SQL characters.</li>
  <li>Least Privilege Principle: Database users should have minimal necessary permissions.</li>
  <li>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): Blocks SQLi patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
<h3>Definition & Types</h3>
<p>XSS involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Types include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stored XSS: Malicious script stored on the server (e.g., in a comment).</li>
  <li>Reflected XSS: Script reflected off a web request (e.g., via URL parameters).</li>
  <li>DOM-based XSS: Manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) in the browser.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real-World Case Study: eBay (2014)</h3>
<p>
  In 2014, attackers exploited a stored XSS vulnerability on eBay, injecting JavaScript into 
  product listings. This redirected users to phishing sites, stealing login credentials.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Output Encoding: Converts scripts into harmless text.</li>
  <li>Content Security Policy (CSP): Restricts script execution sources.</li>
  <li>Input Sanitization: Removes or neutralizes harmful scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>
<h3>Definition & Mechanism</h3>
<p>
  CSRF tricks users into executing unwanted actions on a web app where they’re authenticated 
  (e.g., changing passwords or transferring funds).
</p>

<h3>Real-World Case Study: Netflix (2006)</h3>
<p>
  Attackers sent phishing emails with hidden image tags forcing logged-in Netflix users to add 
  DVDs to their queues without consent.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CSRF Tokens: Unique tokens validate legitimate requests.</li>
  <li>SameSite Cookies: Prevents cookies from being sent in cross-site requests.</li>
  <li>Double-Submit Cookie: Requires token in both cookie and form data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Session Hijacking</h2>
<h3>Definition & Techniques</h3>
<p>
  Attackers steal session IDs (via session fixation, packet sniffing, or XSS) to impersonate users.
</p>

<h3>Real-World Case Study: Firesheep (2010)</h3>
<p>
  The Firesheep tool intercepted unencrypted session cookies on public Wi-Fi, allowing attackers 
  to hijack Facebook, Twitter, and other accounts.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTTPS Encryption: Protects session IDs in transit.</li>
  <li>Secure & HttpOnly Cookies: Prevents JavaScript access.</li>
  <li>Session Timeout & Regeneration: Limits session validity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks</h2>
<h3>Definition & Methods</h3>
<p>
  MITM attackers intercept and alter communications between two parties 
  (e.g., via Wi-Fi eavesdropping, DNS spoofing, or SSL stripping).
</p>

<h3>Real-World Case Study: Superfish (2015)</h3>
<p>
  Lenovo pre-installed Superfish adware, which injected self-signed certificates, 
  allowing MITM attacks on HTTPS traffic.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTTPS (SSL/TLS): Encrypts data in transit.</li>
  <li>Certificate Pinning: Ensures only trusted certificates are accepted.</li>
  <li>VPN Usage: Secures connections on public networks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Modern web security threats are evolving, but robust defenses like input validation, encryption, 
  secure coding practices, and security headers can mitigate risks. Developers must stay informed 
  about emerging threats and adopt a security-first approach in web programming.
